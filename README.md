Interactive Graphing Tool for Linear and Quadratic Equations
This graphing tool allows you to enter parameters for linear and quadratic equations to dynamically visualize their graphs. It’s perfect for students, educators and anyone interested in visualizing equation.
This tool:
Helps you understand the impact of parameters on graphs.
Visualizes slope, y-intercept, and parabola vertex behavior.
Quickly test values for equations in assignments.
Features
Graph linear equations in the form: y=mx+b.  Enter m (slope) and b (y-intercept).                                                                                                      

Graph quadratic equations in the form:  y = ax^2 + bx + c,  Enter a, b, and c. 
Visualize equations 

Interactive plotting with immediate feedback.


Tips for Exploration
For Linear Equations: 
To plot y=x, Try m=1, b=0.
Change m and observe the steepness or flatness of the line
For Quadratic Equations:
Try a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 to plot y=x2.
Adjust a to see how the parabola widens or narrows.
